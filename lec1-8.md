# Business Ethics
## Basics of Ethics

### a priori vs a posteriori
+ **a priori** - Noble without experience
    - Scientific facts
    - True by definition
    - Fundamental about morality
+ **a posteriori** - Noble through experience
    - Reason about what should be the case

### Descriptive vs Normative
+ **Descriptive** - Describes the way the world is or could be. 
    - **a priori**.
        + It is sunny outside
        + The board is green
        + Slightly past 10:03
        + Kareem Abdule Jabaar is taller than Tom Cruze
            - The is no evaluation. Not some evaluative judgement.
        + This is a murder
+ **Normative** - Evaluative judgement. How the world could or should be or
  evaluations of the world. Certain kinds of comparisons not based on
  objectivity. Some ideal to measure up to. Evaluative judgments. If there were
  no people in the world... (kind of). 
    + Bridging the gap between the facts and what is "right or wrong"
    + Examples
        - **a posteriori**
            + It is bad to have a gender pay gap
            + Resevoir dogs is better than kill bill
            + German chocolate cake is tasty
            + Killing a person is wrong.
        - **a priori**
            + Murder is wrong.
                - Murder is a wrongful killing.
+ Ways to differentiate
    - Is vs ought
        + The way to world is vs the way the world ought to be
    - Fact vs value
        + Something is 3 meters tall vs something is pretty
+ Is...ought gap (Hume)
    - Cannot move from is -> ought.
    - Given it is true that you can do something, it may not necessarily be true
      that you ought.
+ You can move from ought -> is
    - If you ought to do something, it is possible that you can.
    - Not necessarily true from a religious perspective. Ideal you live up to

### Values
#### Intrinsic vs Instrumental
- Intrinsically valuable
    + Value that cannot be reduced to a kind or source.
    + !instrumentally
    + Examples
        - Individually people?
        - Relationships (friendship - probably mixed)?
- Instrumentally valuable
    + When it helps you get something else you value
    + Examples
        - Toasters -> Helps you get toast
        - Gold -> Things to look pretty + electronics

### Legal vs Illegal vs Moral vs Nonmoral vs Immoral
#### Legal and Illegal 
+ Your usage of judge may not be immoral but is illegal
+ parking ticket may be illegal but may not be immoral.
+ Columbia it is illegal to have clothesline, but it is not immoral
#### Moral vs Immoral vs Nonmoral
+ **Nonmoral** - An issue in which morals is not in play.
    + There can be a gradient
    + Examples
        + Deciding what shirt to wear is a nonmoral
        + Impolite to paint your house an interesting color

### Reasons
#### Prima facia vs conclusive
+ **prima facia** - can be out weight by another reason
    - You really want to play horizon zero dawn. You have a reason to buy a ps4
      as it is exclusive. But, all things considered, you may not want to buy a
      playstation 4.
+ **conslusive** - They cannot be outweighed
    - It is wrong to commit rape; therefore, you should not commit rape no
      matter the reasons.
+ Sometimes you weigh up all **prima facia** reasons to determine whether or not
  you should do something.
    - Stealing is wrong. If you family is starving, you may have some reason to
      steal.
#### Appeals
+ Appeals to consequences - There may be consequences for the reasoning
+ Appeals to rules - Rules that hold fast
+ Appeals to virtues - By doing it you express a virtue
#### Private vs Public
+ When you chose to do something and you wonder why it is you should or
  shouldn't. 
    - **Public**
        + Some will be reasons other people will accept
        + When we want to justify our actions or morality
        + Consumer protection
    - **Private**
        + Some will be reasons other people will not accept
        + Bible dietary restrictions

## Social Irresponsibility
+ A decision to accept an alternative that is thought by the decision maker to be
  better but do the action anyways (important).
+ A decision maker knows there is a better option, but does it anyway
### Panalba Case Study
+ 97% said the panalba case was socially irresponsible
+ 79% chose e (Fight it)
+ 21% chose d or less

## Morality
+ Consequentialism
    - What makes it good or bad is determined by its consequences
+ Value theory
    - Theory of what is good, theory of what is valuable
+ Possible interpretations
    + Consequence based
    + Maximizes good consequences
    + Net consequences
        - Lives
        - Income

## Utilitarianism
+ Consequentialism + a Value Theory (important)
+ Only thing is valuable is utility
+ Maximize utility
+ Utility is happiness
    - Pleasure, in general, and the absence of pain, in general, i.e. any being
      (important)
+ Social advocates
    + John Stewart Mill (important)
        - Death penatly for utilitarianism
    + Jeremy Benthim
+ Maximize net aggregate happiness (important)
### Types
+ **Act utilitarianism**: You look at the action and ask if it maximized net
  aggregate happiness (utility). Evaluate what you should do based on the
  particular action. (important)
+ **Rule utilitarianism**: Follow moral rules that when generally followed
  maximize net aggregate happiness (utility). (important)
### Trolley Car
+ utilitarianism would "by-in-large demand" that you sacrifice one person to
  save five.
### "Drowning" problem
If your mother and pope are drowning in a pond, who do you save?
+ The pope from a utilitarianism perspective
    - 1 billion - family pain = ~1 billion
### Panalba Case
+ Act
    - Recall the drug immediately as it minimizes total loses
+ Rule
    - Board members should represent the stockholders and care about their
      profits bill passed
    - If you maximize the rule, you will on average maximize happiness.
### Lying Rule + Stealing Rule
+ Degrading public trust if lying was permissible
+ If you could steal property rights would be degraded
### Chopping up Chuck
A surgeon has patient and everyone is dying of a different kind of organ
failure. Homeless man walks in with a broken arm and has a match for all five
patients.
+ Act utilitarian
    - redistribute his organs
+ Rule utilitarian
    - Hospitals would be the most dangerous place to live

## Lecture 4

### Objections (important)
#### Rule Worship Objection (Rule Utilitarian)
There will be situations you recognize that you could do that will promote
happiness, but the rule tells you that you shouldn't do it. Therefore, you
should be an act utilitarian so that all situation can maximize net aggregate
happiness.

#### Demandingness
If a moral system demands too much of you, it must be wrong. If it is
impractical for you to accomplish, it must be the wrong moral system.

##### No partiality
You cannot show any favoritism to yourself or anyone else. Making a decision
between sacrificing yourself or someone who will produce one unit more utility
may be "too psycologically demanding".

##### Maximizing happiness
There might be options that are good, but you must **maximize**. If something
produces 10 units of utility or 9 units of utility you **must** choose 10 units
of utility.

#### Calculation Objection
We have no idea how to calculate utility. Its the immediate + forever
consequences.

#### Injustice
Utilitarianism gives us the wrong answer in some cases in which we are **morally
required** to do unjust things. 

Angry mob standing outside demanding a guilty verdict for innocent person. Mob
will burn down town. Utilitarianism would demand killing of innocent person to
maximize happiness for the mob.

### Immanuel Kant
+ Very rarely leaves Prussia.
+ Daniel Hume "awoke him from his dogmatic slumber"
+ Universality
    - Can everyone do a similar action
+ Imperative sentence
    - A command. "Tell me an imperative sentence"
#### Types of Imperatives
**Hypothetical Imperatives**: Commands that apply sometimes under some
conditions in some circumstances to some people.
**Categorical Imperatives**: Applies always. Ten commandments. Our capacity to
be rational allows us to derive these imperatives (Kant). What morality is about
is about these categorical imperatives (Kant).

##### The Categorical Imperative (important)
1. Act only that on that maxim such that you can will it become universal law. (important)
    - **Maxim**: General rule of behavior. If you want something, you can steal it.
    - **universal law**: We imagine a scenario in which everyone follows that
      rule without some kind of contradiction.
    - Something like the golden rule, but 'better'.
        + i.e. a sadist is a masocist following the golden rule
    + Example: 
        - Slavery. If you don't want to do the dishes you can enslave your neighbor,
          but they will continue down that chain. No hierarchy will be established
          and nothing will get done. Produces a contradiction.
        - **contradiction**: Does not allow you to accomplish your acquired end.
        - Lying. You might be put in a situation you think is permissible for me to
          lie. Imagine a world where everyone lies. Lying -> trying to get
          something. If everyone knows everyone else is lying, you cannot actually
          get what you're trying to get. Breaks the categorical imperative.
2. Principle of humanity. Always treat humanity whether yourself or others as an
   end and never as a mere means.
    - Always treat humanity as intrinsically and not instrumentally valuable.
    - example:
        + You should not be rude to stewardess as they can be thrown away. You
          should not treat pilot as unimportant except to get you from A->B.
          Respect they have their own goals and own intrinsic value.
    - Motives are important. The ends wont always justify the means.
##### Permissible vs Morally Valuable
You can do things that are permissible, but morally valuable is solely because
the rules required.

Example: helping the old lady. If you help the old lady based on wanting
something it is not morally praiseworthy. If you solely do it based on moral
rules it is morally valuable.

## Lecture 5
### Criticism of Kantianism
+ Gives the wrong kind of answers in certain situations
    - You cannot lie
        - Hiding Holocaust victims in your house from Nazis
        - Hiding someone in your house to be murdered
    - You cannot kill one person to save the world
    - You cannot steal
        + someone has a rocket that could save the world
+ Humanity
    - Marginal person problem (What exactly counts as humanity)
        + Rational beings, something able to understand the moral law
            - Cats may not fall under this definition
            - Babies do not count under this definition
            - Mentally infirmed
### Virtue Ethics
+ Aristotelian Ethics
+ Looks at the character of the person. Whether or not a person in the right
  character would engage in lying in that scenario
    - What makes for a good doctor, what makes for a bad doctor, then ascribe to
      the good
+ **Happiness**: Living well. 
    - Honor, money, pleasure? No.
    - Pleasure is a morality for swine.
        + If it is 'just good', it doesn't matter where you get it
        + Only good with qualitification
+ **Function**: Everything is classified by a function and can be determined to
  do that function good or bad. Must be unique to that thing
    + **Example**: Knife
        - A good knife cuts well
        - A bad knife cannot cut
    + What is humans function?
        - Just Living? No, animals do that.
        - Going around sensing? No, animals do that to.
        - Rationality? Seems so!
+ Humans (important)
    + Engaging with rational activity with the soul in accordance with virtue
    + Attaining Eudaimonia
        - A state of human flourishing
        - A state of being 
    + It is important that we know the virtue
        - Easier to hit the target if you know where it is
+ Virtues
    - Justice
    - Temporance
    - Courage
+ Vices
    - Deficiency
    - Excess
+ Doctrine of the mean (important)
    - Virtue lies between two vices except for Justice 
+ Virtues have to due to consistent actions
    - Important to instill a good character so that in a bad time, you will do
      the right thing
+ Context is very important
    - What is the virtuous thing for me to do
    - This makes collective decisions hard
+ Not very "action guiding"

## Lecture 6 (Mill on Libery)
+ Talks about Governmental role of governing liberty
+ Quantify business ethics on
    + Economic Facts
    + Fundamental moral principles
    + Politics (Underlying theory of government)
        - Appropriate role for government to play
### Mill On Government
+ Government originally was a necessary evil. Used for instrumental good of
  private property and protection
+ Democractic government
    - Government is now representatives of us, so we don't necessarily need to
      worry about controlling them
        + Constitutional checks -> division of power
        + Certain fundamental rights -> if violated, could be defended with
          violence
        + Doesn't necessarily need to be constraint if they represent us
    - Leads to **Tyranny of the Majority**
+ Tyranny of the Majority
    - Convince others that they are the majority
    - Also applies culturally and societally
+ There exists a limit that a society may interfere with its people
+ The only legitimate reason for people to interfere is if they harm others
  (important)
    - Self-harm is NOT something that should be regulated
#### Harm Principle
- One cannot regulate over self harm
- Can convince but cannot coherse
- Based on utility
    + If society is left on its own, it will maximize the utility
    + You can be forced to give testominy in court
    + You can be forced to work for your government under credible threat
- Does not apply to everyone
    + If your reason is not fully developed, you can be acted for
        - Children
        - Handicap
        - Barbarians
        - Underdeveloped societies
+ If there is interference, it is necessary that harm will be done, but
  not the reverse
    - Interference may make thing worse.
+ Sociological harms or roundabout harms are trivial to Mill's idea of direct
  harms that they are different in kind
    - Difference in degree may also indicate a different in kind
        + Short vs Tall
        + Rich vs Poor
    - Some exceptions
        + Social isolation -> driving someone mad
        + Target cognitive development
        + Brainwash
    - No exception
        + Being offended (important)
            - It far more important to your ability to pursue life i.e. breaking
              your arm or destroying your life than be offended
            - You can avoid it
            - Harm prevents us from pursuing goals and interest, but being
              offended doesn't
+ First Ammendment
    - Protects you from the tyranny of society as well
+ Tolerance is not accepting everyone
    - The ability to judge them as wrong, but they can purse their own lives
      anyway
    - Requires disagreement
