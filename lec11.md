# McCoy - Parable of the Suhdi
+ Close to the Parable of the Good Samartian
## Story
+ 60 Day trek - Halfway through
+ New Zealenders bring back a Suhdi
+ McCoy and Steven split
    - Steven
        + Altitude Sickness, decides to take on another burden to save the man
        + Tries to get Japanese to take him down
        + "Have do you feel about contributing to this mans death"

## Moral Dilemma
+ Breakdown between individual and corporate ethics
    - No one person was willing to take personal accountability
+ Should the corporation as a whole take responsibility or an individual?
+ If the circumstances would have been different, they may have been more
  willing to take the individual ethic
    - More likely to help those like you (Honda Civic example)
+ Parable of the Good Samartian claims everyone is your neighbor

## Moral Theories
+ Kantinism
    - It is not clear what happens under acts of omissions
    - If everyone ignores other people does it stop from achieve the goal
+ Utilitarian
    - Suffering of one man vs Suffering of everyone in the group
+ Virtue Ethics
    - One should ensure that the Suhdi is cared for
+ **Superarrogitory action**: Going above and beyond the call of duty
    - Morally praiseworthy to do, but not blameworthy to refrain from doing
    - Examples
        - Giving the homeless money
        - Acts of charity

## Individual vs Corporate Ethics
+ Inspite of McCoy's arguments, he still feels guilt
+ Has excuses, but ethical dilemma only shows in difficult circumstances
### Lessons
1. Be more mindful about the conditions we find ourselves in
2. The group should have a vested interest in the individual needs.
    - What Steven wants to do is lend aid, but the 'hiking corporation' is not
      there to help. Corporate culture does not share or allow an individual
      ethic.
    - Management must shape and align everyone's values
3. He didn't think about the advantages to taking the more ambiguous road
    - Not clear what the advantage of taking the Suhdi back
    - His most interesting experience was spent in the village recovering from
      altitude sickness
        + Get to know the people there
        + Cultural anthropologist
    - They may have had a more interesting story to tell
4. Norms and Culture matter
    - Norms and incredibly important and may not be easily undone (important)

## Road to Jericho
+ Whether you're under conditions of stress determines how likely you are to
  help
