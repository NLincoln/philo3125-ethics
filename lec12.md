# Man trying to give everything
+ Lacks objectivity
    - Cannot solve the mans problems
+ The ultimate delusion
    - Believing makes you a little bit more likely to be able to

# A Fine is a Price
## Deterance Hypothesis (deter)
+ Creating a penalty for action it will deter people from doing that act
+ If you remove the deterant, the actions will recur
### Experiments (Daycare)
+ 10 private daycare centers in Israel (important)
    - $380 in 1980 American dollars per child per month
+ Parents come in late to get their kids
    - Teacher must stay to watch them
+ 20 weeks, 4 control groups, 6 with intervention
    - $3.80 flat fee
+ 10 parents were showing up late per week
#### Conclusion 
- After three weeks, the rate goes up (roughly doubles)
- Not saying that fines do not deter
- Depends how much the fine is
    > The introduction of the fine changes the perception of the people
    > regarding the environment in which they operate. Incomplete contract.
    > The consequence of coming late was not specified. The fine reshapes
    > the perception of the environment
- The contract was incomplete and did not specify
    - Lease agreement
        + **security deposit** - unspecified what happens if you do more
          damage
        + **utilities** - If you use a large amount of utilities, you will
          be charged extra
    - Syllabus
        + Missing an exam
        + Late work policy
        + Plagarism
- Parents have no idea what the possible punishments are
- Daycare is willing, only use in exceptional circumstances
    + Fine is the worse thing that will happen
#### Social Norms
+ One not ought to abuse the kindness and generosity of others
    - Overuse would be using teachers as mere means
+ Now there is a price for a service
    - You can buy the good as much as you like
    - Fails to explain that when you remove it
+ Once a commodities, always a commodities
+ Disturbed the norm that was already in place
+ Shift the frame of mind (Economic frame vs Ethical frame)
### IQ Study
+ Pay money to incentivize scores
    - No incentive did better than ones who were incentivized poorly
+ Sometimes paying people nothing lets them perform better than poor payment
+ Utilitarian calculation problem

### Anti-conclusions
+ Does not mean to stop prosecuting crimes
+ However, smaller crimes can be analyzed to prevent increased delinquency
