# Professional Responsibility Just following the rules
## Nuremberg defense
+ The claim of "just following order" therefore one must be excused
    - Guilty of being obedience
+ Role differentiated behavior
+ Moral Luck
### Milgram Experiments
+ 40 male volunteers
+ "schock generator"
+ 40 valves
+ 2/3 participants followed the orders

## What does rule following mean
+ That is not acting responsibly, that is just following the rules
+ "Legalism"
    - Reduces professional responsibility to the professional code of ethics
    - Must have the right understanding of what it is to follow the rules, if
      you know that it will account for things like personal responsibilities
+ Thesis
    - Following the rules is generally enough to follow ethic
    - Rules set standard of professional conduct in a usually robust way is
      acting as a responsible profession
+ "Just following the rules"
### Ways
#### Blind Obedience
+ Never exemplified in adults
+ Child tries to open a cabient to safety lock -> "Use your head" -> Raps head
  into door
+ Unthinking, automatic, done without consideration of possible consequences
#### Strict Obedience
+ Thinking of the individual is ignored, do what is ordered to
+ Think about the consequences, but do it anyway
+ Example
    - Judge things he should do it a certain way, but precendent requires him to
      rule a particular way
    - Charge of the Light Brigade 
        + Crimean War, knew they were being marched to their death
        + Mission that will probably lead to doom, but are strictly obedient
#### Malicious Obedience
+ In order to get back at someone, you strictly enforce the rules
+ Example
    - Police stopping everyone for traffic infractions
+ Common sense and charitable understanding of the rules
    - Rules should be interpreted in such a way to follow that
    - Little place in professional settings
+ Some preambles hold paramount of the safety, welfare, and happiness of public
  while acting as a faithful agent to the employer
+ Suggests a concious misunderstanding of the rules

#### Negligent and Accidental (important)
+ **Negligent** - Unconscious element to express due care
    - Law requires you always exercise due care
    - Moral conduct is above the minimum expectation of due care
    - Don't need a rule for:
        + Surgeons showing up drunk
        + If you do, doesn't do any work (important)
    - Independent duty to not be negligent
+ **Accidental** - Following the rule unconsciously or for the wrong reason
    - Example
        + Mimicry 
        + Busy doing something, don't turn right on red light on red
#### Stupid Obedience
+ One unconsciously does not express do care due to incompetence 
+ You may try to read rule and do what it says
    - Case law that claims how you interpret it
+ Example
    + Captain Spalding
        - "Shoot elephants in Pajamas"
#### Interpretive Obedience
+ You must understand the:
    - context of the rule
    - purpose of the rules
    - how rules relate to one another (precedent)
    - interpretive strategies
    - consequences of mistakes
    - rules can be revised to fit the intended purposes
    - rules as courses of actions
+ One is only following the rules under this interpretation
+ Virtue of having the disposition to interpret the rules correctly and doing
  appropriate action
+ Must do a lot more than you normally do (important)
+ Rules must be well-written
+ Conditional overwrites general
