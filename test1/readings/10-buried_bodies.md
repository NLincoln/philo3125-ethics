# Buried Bodies Case
## Background
+ Adirondack mountians
+ 10am man stumbled around 4 campers
+ Told them to step out of tents
    + "I've killed before and I'll kill again"
    + I am going to take your gas
+ Tied themselves as he pointer his gun at them
+ Stabbed and killed Phillip with Buck Knife
+ The man caught one of them
+ Locals came and saved the boy
+ Manhunt commenced
+ Robert Garrow
    - Ex convict (rape)
+ "People locked their door for the first time"
    - People left in a hurry and left their food and shelter behind
    - Garrow lived on this food
+ 1970s
## Ethical Dilemma
+ Frank Armani
    - Lawyer in Syracuse
    - Was picked on and would not walk away
+ Had history with Garrow
    - School teacher assaulted child, wanted to sue school
    - Automobile accident
    - Kidnapping two college kids
    - Molesting two underaged girls
        + Escaped
+ Had trepidation about representing Armani
    - But Garrow only wanted him, Judge said "Do it or I will appoint you"
+ Francis Belge
    - Didn't want to be apart of it (lose-lose case)
    - Insanity case
    - "Big case"
+ Garrow was put in training observation room after being shot and captured
    - Cops brought in lip reader to try to find any information
    - There is a potential murder and missing girl
    - "Lawyer must be able to share everything with lawyers and have trust"
+ Wanted mental hospital instead of lawyer
+ Garrow poured soul out to Belge
    - Had killed multiple people
    - Followed a pattern:
        1. Headaches
        2. Psychotic
        3. Did not remember details
    - Garrow told lawyers he had killed two high-profile missing girls and told
      them where the bodies were
        + "She got stabbed with my knife"
        + Could be a dream or delusion
    - They go to check out the bodies
    - The bodies were hidden in an air vent
    - Options:
        1. Call police
            - No, attonery client priviledge 
            - Anything that is related to client is under confidentiality
            - "Except reasonably certain death or serious harm"
            - No future crime, its over
                + Regardless of circumstances
    - Attorney has role-differented behavior to support his client at all costs
+ Tried to leverage the two bodies to get a deal
    - "Are you seriously barganing with peoples lives
+ Prosecutor did not want to give pardon to the biggest profile case
+ Father of the daughter flew in
    - Asked father to father "Is there anything you can tell me about my
      daughter"
    - Couldn't tell him, "nothing I can tell you"
+ Armani empathized with the father, but could not tell him anything
+ They go to trial because there is no deal, make insanity defense
+ The silence leads to
    - Doubt, "Am I in the right profession". Looking for ways to get them the
      information. Make an anonymous call? (Pride to do it openly)
    - Doing what he thought was the right, proper, ethical, moral thing to do. 
+ The Trial
    - Garrow told life story to show he was nuts
        - Severe beatins, abuse
        - low education
        - Indentured servant
        - Slaughting bulls, drinking blood, beastiality
    - Belge asks "Is that the one I found?" with regards to the body
    - Everyone turned against them
+ Prosecutors say "Bodies used as pawns in a game of law"
    - Phone calls
    - Death threats
    - Dead fish in car, unlit molotov cocktail
+ Armani was relived when the trial ended
    - People then wanted to bring up criminal charges
        + States public health law, obstruction of justice, tampering with
          evidence
        + Ethical complaint to the bar
    - All dismissed
+ "I was a lawyer who does did his job, I was a good lawyer. I thought so"
    - Virtue Ethics
+ Buried bodies case is now taught in legal ethics
    - Represents the client's best interest
+ Talking to families
    - Susan Petz
    - Horrified that the attorney client privilege is correct from the
      perpesctive of this case
    - Criminal vs the victims
        + Equal or greater consideration to the criminal vs victim
