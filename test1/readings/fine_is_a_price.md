# A Fine is a Price
## Background
+ Deterence Hypothesis
    - The indtroduction of a penalty that leaves everything else unchanges will
      reduce the occurrence of the behavior subject to the fine
+ Daycare center contradicts the deterence hypothesis
+ Introduced fine for late-coming parents
    - The number of late-coming parents increased significantly
    - After the fine was removed, no reduction occurred
+ Penalties are introduced into an incomplete contract, social or private
+ Studies:
    - Negative consequences -> reduction of particular repsonse
    - Negative consequences removed -> behavior reappears
    - Change induced depend on severity of punishment, stimulus or actual
      behavior.
    - Punishment is most effective when it is certain and immediately follows
      behvaior
    - Adapation develops to punishment
        + if severity and other parameters are left unchanges, its effectiveness
          tends to decrease
### Study
+ 10 day-care centers over a 20 week period
    - 4 weeks for data collection
    - 5th week - fine at 6 of the 10 day-cares for more than 10 minutes late
      (control for other 4)
+ Fine introduction cause increase of parents coming late
+ After 2-3 weeks, it stabilized to higher than before
+ The fine was then removed, and the late-coming parents remained the same
### Initial Conclusions
+ Fine changing the perception of the environment (incomplete contract)
+ Parents formed their own beliefs about what would happen if they showed up
  late

## The Study
### Background
+ 10 private day-care centers in Haifa, Israel in 1998 with no important
  differences
+ $380 dollars a month
+ Contract states the center operates between 0730 and 1600 with no mention of
  what happens after
+ Explained when teacher was hired they stay late
### Results
+ The possibility that a punishment would increase behavior was not consiered
  from either a theorectical or empirical point of view
+ Differences
    + "Crime" was very midle and so were the punishments
    + No uncertainty of punishment exists
    + "fine changes the agent's perception of the social situation they are
      involved in"
#### Model of Differential Information and Incomplete Contracts
+ Implicit contract
    - "In extreme circumstances, we will take care of your children free of
      charge. Only when strictly necessary. Overuse may ruselt in punishment"
    - The fine is now the worse thing that can happen
+ Parents slowly test the day-care's reaction to higher levels of delays
+ After removal of the fine, they have no reason to anticipate anything worse
  than the fine.
#### Simple formal Model
1.  In the initial period there is a low level of late arrivals.
2.  If off the equilibrium path the owner charges a fine, then parents believe
    she is mild and increase the number of delays.
3.  If later the fine is removed, parents still  believe the owner is mild and
    they do not change their behavior
#### Multiple Equilibria
+ Multiple parents coming in late does not increase cost to owner (only if one
  comes in late)
+ If one person comes in late, they might as well all come in late
+ If no one comes in late, that person is inflicting much higher cost to the
  owner
#### Social Norms
+ Teachers were being generous, nonmarket activity
    -  I should not take advantage of her patience
+ The fine states "The teacher is taking care of the child like she did earlier
  in the day. I can buy this service as much as needed"
    - However, this is a fine, not a payment offered for service
+ "A Fine is a price"
    - Payment as a price or fine are quivalent
+ "One a commodity, always a commodity"
#### No Reward and Zero Reward
+ A group payed very little has worse performance than when no compenstation is
  offered
+ Mentioning payment is enough to change perception of contract
    - Market exchange
### Conclusions: Incomplete contracts and incentives
+ fine increased behavior and was not reduced when removed
+ Fines and rewards are decided in a large context with convenience as a game
+ Strategic situations with money
+ More severely punishing tax evasion may have a different consequence
