# Parable of the Sadhu
+ Bowen McCoy
    - Managing director of Morgan Stanley
+ 30 days in 60 day hike
+ Sadhu
    - Indian Holy man
    - Shrines at Muktinath
+ "How do you feel about contributing to the death of a fellow man"
    - No one person was willing to take moral responsibility for the Sahdu
    - Each was willing to do just a bit as long as it was not too inconvient
    - Passed of whe it got hard
+ What if the Sadhu had been one of their own
+ Fulfilled obligations if:
    1. the Sadhu dies in our care
    2. the Sadhu demonstrates that he could undertake the two-day walk down to
       the villeg
    3. We carry the Sadhu for two days down to the villege and convince someone
       there to care for him
