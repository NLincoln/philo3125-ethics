+ Lack of analytical rigor and preciseness
    + Business cannot have a social responsibility
        - Only people have social responsibilities
        - Makes no sense, amorphous business sector
    + Individual businesses it still makes no sense
        - Responsibility for taxes, but still no social responsibility
        - Cannot interact socially in the right way
    + "Businesses aren't people, but businesses have responsibility"

+ Particular Advocate within Business
    + We would need a particular person i.e. employee
        - You should not spend resources of other people for your own personal ends
        - Employee has responsibility to do job you are hired to do
        - example
            + Plumber should not bill 30 minutes for helping old lady
            + Spend time working website to save the birds, using employeer as a
              mere means to save the birds. Failed to do basic work of employee. Not
              virtuous.
+ If you're doing what you would do anyway, you shouldn't get credit for it.
    - Only should do things you were otherwise going to do
+ Imposing cost on others (employees, customers, etc.), moving their own goals
    - Sort of tax, it is not free if not within the context of the business

      political mechanism instead of market mechanisms to distribute resources.

      should be sacrific

        - Hard to value carbon, future, or costs and benefits for climate change
            + No price attached

    - Fundraising as private individual vs spending business capital
