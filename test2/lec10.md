# Carson - Second thoughts about bluffing
A. Appearances to the contrary this kind of practice typically does not
   constitute lying. Standard dictionary definitions are unformulated. They
   don't count as lies in this society

## Thesis A
+ Performs steelmaning instead of straw-maning
    - Utter a falsehood with the intent to deceive (important)
+ Misses one element about the believe statements of one individual
+ Witness gives false statement when threatened to tell a lie about a murder
    - The witness does not intent to deceive at all only to preserve their life
+ The bluffing about his negotiating argument is not under the definition of
  lying
+ Dictionary fails to capture all and only definitions of cases we would
  consider lying
+ Rossian idea of lying
    - Certain acts we would consider wrong are sometimes accepted
    - Promise to meet friend for lunch and breaking that promise is only prima
      facia wrong
        - extenuating cirumstances
+ When we engage in conversation, we are implicitly making a promise about what
  we say is true
    - Prima Facia
    - Transparency thesis
        - "The sky is blue" -> "It is true that the sky is blue" are equivalent
        - We presume that when "the sky is blue" it is true, makes it redundant
+ Maxim of Quality
    - What you say is actually true, implicit presumption and promise that what
      we say is true
+ This presumption of truth is not always there
    - Certain contexts such as games or sarcasm 
+ No all audiences understand context in the same way
    - Telling some friends of yours about an exaggerated story
    - The adults understand its an exaggeration, but children might think it is
      literal
+ Context and audience sensitive new definition
    + S lies to x if, and only if, S makes a false statement which he does not
      believe to be true and in so doing warrants the truth of the statement to
      x.
    + Warrant
        - Invite others to rely on it and assure them that it can be relied upon
        - Context dictated
    + Solomon agrees
        - Advertisements do not warrant your taking it that it is true
        - Conventions should not dictate you take action against big mac
          advertisement
+ I will accept nothing less than $80,000 dollars does not warrant the truth
    - Haggling is a reasonable expectation
    - Certain gains to be made anytime you engage in a trade
    - Carson claims it is not a lie because people mistake their negotiating
      position
        + Stating whatever falsehood does not fall under this 
        + You must accurately give the condition of the good you are selling
+ Poker
    - Claims about the strength of one hand are not warranted
    - Rules of the game and procedure are warranted
## Carson and Carr
+ Any action or practice engaged in by businesspeople in a iven society is
  morally permissible provided that it is consistent with the ethical rules or
  principles which are generally accepted in that society
    - Because businessmen do them, they are morally permissible
+ Any action or practice  engaged in  by businesspeople in a given  society is
  morally  permissible provided  that it is consistent  with the laws of that
  society.
    - Bluffing is not against the law therefore fine
+ Any action or practice  engaged in  by businesspeople in a given  society is
  morally  permissible  provided  that it  is consistent  with both i)  the
  society's conventional  ethical  rules or principles  governing  those
  actions and practices, and ii) the laws of that  society.
+ These are all bad according to Carson
    - Slavery is an example that follow these 3 constraints
        + When it was legal, morally permissible
        + Suddently when it was illegal, now it is no longer morally permissible
+ Disagree in reason but not with conclusion
