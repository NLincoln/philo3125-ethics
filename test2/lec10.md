# Carson - Second thoughts about bluffing
A. Appearances to the contrary this kind of practice typically does not
   constitute lying. Standard dictionary definitions are unformulated. They
   don't count as lies in this society (important - in this society)
    - What the society expects is important

## Thesis A
+ Performs steelmaning instead of straw-maning
    - Utter a falsehood with the intent to deceive (important)
+ Misses one element about the believe statements of one individual
+ Witness gives false statement when threatened to tell a lie about a murder
    - The witness does not intent to deceive at all only to preserve their life
+ The bluffing about his negotiating argument is not under the definition of
  lying
+ Dictionary fails to capture all and only definitions of cases we would
  consider lying
+ Rossian idea of lying
    - Certain acts we would consider wrong are sometimes accepted
    - Promise to meet friend for lunch and breaking that promise is only prima
      facia wrong
        - extenuating cirumstances
+ When we engage in conversation, we are implicitly making a promise about what
  we say is true
    - Prima Facia
    - Transparency thesis
        - "The sky is blue" -> "It is true that the sky is blue" are equivalent
        - We presume that when "the sky is blue" it is true, makes it redundant
+ Maxim of Quality
    - What you say is actually true, implicit presumption and promise that what
      we say is true
+ This presumption of truth is not always there
    - Certain contexts such as games or sarcasm 
+ No all audiences understand context in the same way
    - Telling some friends of yours about an exaggerated story
    - The adults understand its an exaggeration, but children might think it is
      literal
+ Context and audience sensitive new definition
    + S lies to x if, and only if, S makes a false statement which he does not
      believe to be true and in so doing warrants the truth of the statement to
      x.
    + Warrant
        - Invite others to rely on it and assure them that it can be relied upon
        - Context dictated
    + Solomon agrees
        - Advertisements do not warrant your taking it that it is true
        - Conventions should not dictate you take action against big mac
          advertisement
+ I will accept nothing less than $80,000 dollars does not warrant the truth
    - Haggling is a reasonable expectation
    - Certain gains to be made anytime you engage in a trade
    - Carson claims it is not a lie because people mistake their negotiating
      position
        + Stating whatever falsehood does not fall under this 
        + You must accurately give the condition of the good you are selling
+ Poker
    - Claims about the strength of one hand are not warranted
    - Rules of the game and procedure are warranted
+ Things that you must say in truth (important)
    - Quality of the item
    - History of the items
    - Competiting offers
    - Rules of the game, state of the world other than your individual
      preferences
## Carson and Carr (important)
+ Any action or practice engaged in by businesspeople in a iven society is
  morally permissible provided that it is consistent with the ethical rules or
  principles which are generally accepted in that society
    - Because businessmen do them, they are morally permissible
+ Any action or practice  engaged in  by businesspeople in a given  society is
  morally  permissible provided  that it is consistent  with the laws of that
  society.
    - Bluffing is not against the law therefore fine
+ Any action or practice  engaged in  by businesspeople in a given  society is
  morally  permissible  provided  that it  is consistent  with both i)  the
  society's conventional  ethical  rules or principles  governing  those
  actions and practices, and ii) the laws of that  society.
+ These are all bad according to Carson
    - Slavery is an example that follow these 3 constraints
        + When it was legal, morally permissible
        + Suddently when it was illegal, now it is no longer morally permissible
+ Disagree in reason but not with conclusion

## Thesis B
+ We can take thesis b seperately than thesis B
+ It is usually permissible to mistake ones bargain permission when one has
  reason to believe the other party is doing the same

### Reasons
+ Can be overwritten by other prima facie reasons
+ Self-defense principle
    - Can do certain things that are wrong if we are doing something in
      self-defense
    - Killing is prima facie wrong
        + Certain circumstances would allow you to kill a person if that is the
          only way to prevent you from being killed
    - Can only do something less or equally bad to you
        + Cannot kill someone to prevent stealing your wallet
    - Can do something equally or morally less bad to prevent someone from doing
      harm to you
+ SD 
    > For any act a such that doing a to someone is ordinarily prima facie wrong
    > qua act of aing someone, X's doing a to Y is not prima facie wrong qua
    > act  of aing someone  (or at  least  substantially less prima facie wrong
    > qua  act of aing  than it would  otherwise  be) provided  that:  1) Y is
    > doing or trying  to do a (or something which is ordinarily
    > equally prima facie wrong) to x, 2) X is likely to be  harmed as a result,
    > and 3) X can't prevent or mitigate this harm unless he does a 
+ Bluffing could cause harm
    - Getting something better at your expense. Additional dollars you spend
      represent lost purchasing power, you no longer have the extra money to
      save or spend
    - You would be harmed even if you walked away from the negotiation
        + Anchoring
            - Priming
                + Spinning unreletated wheel primed you to guess more countries
                  in africa
                + Looking at a price of a good will set an anchor for you,
                  expectation for how much a good should cost
            - If someone lies, you'll come to think that future deals will be at
              a steal compared to the previous price
+ Retailiation
    - Preventing yourself from incurring certain harms, not recompensating
      yourself for harms received
+ In our society, there is an expectation that someone will mistate their
  bargaining position, but not true in all cases:
    - First time home buyer (ignorant or naive to the rules of home buying)
    - "I swear to you on my mothers grave this is the lowest you can expect"
+ Not clear what counts as a comparable harm
    - You vs Bill Gates (How much harm can you do to bill gates knowing he will
      mistate his bargaining position)
        + Is the most you are allowed to bluff up to his dollar amount? However
          $5000 dollars is not a lot to bill gates. Should you do it indexed to
          their wealth? How much impact $5000 would have? Whats equal regarding
          dollar value?
+ Carson does not state self defense is the only scenario you can misstate your
  bargaining position
    - Telling the truth may hurt you and you can prevent it by bluffing
    - Trying to protect the interest of your sick child
    - In extreme need or dire circumstances 

#### Rule Utilitarian
+ SDU 
    > is permissible  to harm  another person  by means  of doing  an act  of  type
    > X, provided  that  1) doing x (or  some other  act against  which  there  is
    > an equally strong  moral  presumption)  is  necessary  in  order  to  prevent
    > that  person  from harming  one  by  means  of  performing  an act  of type x
    > (or is  necessary  in  order to substantially  mitigate the harm that the
    > other person  will (otherwise)  inflict  on one by doing (or trying to do) an
    > act of type x), and 2) the harm one inflicts on (innocent) third parties  by
    > xing does not outweigh  the harm one prevents by doing x
+ If you don't allow people to protect themselves, they can be taken advantage
  of (predatory behavior)
+ Individuals who protect themselves have more extrinsic value
    - Individuals who are violent or will do violence to other people, do not
      promot utility, they are not equally valuable 
+ SDU does NOT speak to all cases
    - Puts it forth as something that seems plausible and is strong enough to
      give the correct answer for bluffing
    - A strong principle (superset) would account for bluffing as being
      permissible

## Deception vs Lying
+ Deception is equally bad or worse than lying
    - "He is with bob watching the game" does not count as a vicious falsehood
      for Solomon
    - Brother come in an offer at $85000 and say to the other person "they were
      here first, do you want to meet the offer"
        + Putting pressure on the negotating party, strong arm them to make a
          decision, cannot call BS to the other person. Undue pressure
