# Freeman - A Stakeholder Theory of the Modern Corporation
## Stakeholders 
+ Anyone who can be affected
+ Whoever is necessary for the viability for the company
+ Narrow
    - Closely related to the business
+ Broad
    - Anyone who can be impacted
+ "For whose benefit and at whose expense should the firm be managed?"
+ Shareholders are one category of stakeholders
## Freeman
+ Cannot make tradeoffs between customers and shareholders
+ Shareholder theory creates value for shareholders and stakeholders
+ Adopting a stakeholder theory is a means of maximizing stakeholder value
    - Long term self interest, balancing act is short sighted
+ Monopoly or regulation preventing entering of new businesses (no competitors)
    - Mafia
+ Idea of inclusivity
    - A genre, type of theory
    - Utilitiarism, virtue ethics
    - Attach it to a "normative core"
        + Ecological "normative core"
            - Consider interests of environment more broadly
## Stakeholder vs Stockholder
+ Difference of frame not of correctness
    - Scope of Stakeholder is larger
+ Trying to get individuals to define the goal of business in a certain way
+ Can put them both purely in economic frames
+ Both consider a local view

## Hicks
+ Hicks believes win-win scenarios align interest is the proper frame
    - Complies with Freeman

## Sudhi
+ Steven is not supported to ensure the well being of the Sudhi
+ Not aligned with the corporate goal of getting to the peak
+ Stakeholder claims you must consider Steven and align everyone's interest
+ Looking for opportunities in which everyone can win

## Considerations
+ "Who is central to the viability of the corporation"
    - Are united auto workers really necessary for the success?
        + Employees are necessary but not necessarily the specific employees
        + People from the local community who rely on the work
        + Depends on kinds of employment
            - Sometimes you need highly skilled labor
+ Management view in general
    - Consider all individuals who might be affected
    - Government?
        + Yes, we can identify actual stakeholders
            - Citizens
            - The world (trade)
            - Migrants
        + Nationalist vs Globalist view
+ Potential individuals and property rights
