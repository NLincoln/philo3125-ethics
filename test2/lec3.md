# Stout - The Problem of Corporate Purpose
+ Who holds the view?
    - Economists
    - Chicago School
    - Law
## Arguments against Shareholder Value View
### Bad for Business
+ If you want to maximize shareholder value, we need to think in a different way
### Faulty assumptions of Ownership
+ "Executives are agents of the shareholders"
    - Employees therefore have duties to act as faithful agents of their
      principle (important)
+ Shareholders are owners of the corporation
+ Stout - The claim is incorrect and normatively incorrect
    - Board decides how to pay the shareholders (profits are reinvested,
      employees are given bonuses, dividends)
    - Shareholders are not liable (owners would be liable)
    - Corporation owns itself
        - Shareholder have a contract with that company (voting rights?)
+ Air Products inc.
    - Managers can have power even when it hurts shareholder
    - Could have bought other company at higher than market price, said no, and
      court upheld the decision
### Incoherent as shareholders are not the same
+ Incoherence with shareholder value
+ The company believes...?
    - Each individual person in the board believes an idea

+ "That idea does not have a coherent value of shareholder value"
    - She claims maximizing shareholder value is the only concern, short-term
      immediate value of profits which defines a coherent value
+ Friedman's view does have the idea of single shareholder value; therefore, you
  can focus on different time frames
+ No notion of a single shareholder value
    - Paternity vs Maternity

## Corporate Purpose
+ Ownership or property rights?
+ More stakeholders than just the shareholders?
+ How can a corporation have a purpose?
    - Arbitrary to favor one view of purpose over another
    - May lead to incoherence
