# Meisel and Kuczewski - Legal and Ethical Myths About Informed Consent
+ Transactions are mutually beneficial when free of fraud, deceit, etc.
+ Informed consent is most studied in medical context
## Problems with informed consent
+ Hassel
+ Way too many possible things you can do / outcomes to fully inform
+ Produces a conflict between two responsibilities 
    - Patient autonomy
    - Beneficience, best possible care, maximize patient welfare
+ Autonomy is important
    - Nazi medical experimentation
    - Physician paternalism
        + Degrading
        + Reasonable disagreement about what constitutes the good. You outcome
          and values vs the physicians outcomes and values
    - Patients should be determining outcomes

## Myths
### A signed consent form implies informed consent
+ They may not have read it
+ The consent forms don't always have relevant information or present it in the
  correct way
+ Misunderstands what is actually required
### Medical Maranda Warning
+ Boilerplate statement of what to say
+ Maranda warning tells you about potential risks
    - Too narrow to talk only about potential risks
    - Risks + outcomes + consequences = informed consent
### Physician operate a medical cafeteria
+ They lay out all possible options for the patient and then they have to choose
+ Patients don't want all the treatments, they want advice or recommendation
+ Conversation about what the physician thinks they want is best for them
+ Reasonable options vs all options
### Patients must be told everything about a treatment
+ Don't want micromanagement, but help navigating the space.
+ Standard of information is "reasonable" or "adequate" amount of information
  about treatment outcome and objects
    - Sometimes profession based
    - What a reasonable person would need to know or find important to make the
      decision
### Need full disclosure only if they give consent
+ Expectation of patient compliance 
+ Not clear if you should tell them if they're going to refuse for efficiency
+ Patients need to informed about what they are refusing (implicitly or
  explicitly)
### Patients are dumb
+ Patients don't remember important medical information even after short times
+ Inability to recall doesn't mean you did not competently make the decision
+ Being a competent decision maker does not mean you must understand fully
  understand or in the same way medicine, but you can be told enough information
  to allow you to make a decision
    - Degree of understanding
### Patients can be given information whether they want it or not
+ Part of respecting patient autonomy is respecting how much information they
  want to hear
+ Patients can waive right to inform, right to decide, or both
+ Refusal is not a refusal forever
### Information may be withheld if it would cause the person to refuse treatment
+ If telling them will cause them to choose options to harm themselves, you
  shouldn't tell them
    - Therapeutic privilege 
+ If providing the information will undermine their decision making capability,
  you do not need to tell
    - Examples
        + Being informed you will have to be amputateed will be so distressing
          you will not be able to rationally think about it
        + Given genetic problem to children
        + Pregnant women getting cancer, decision between parent and child
## Conclusions
+ Right to forgo information
    - Where the materials comes from for electronic devices
    - Where the meat you eat comes from
    - Walk into computer repair or mechanic "just fix it, i dont care what it
      takes"
+ Withholding information may not apply for paternalistic reasons
    - Repairing car, looking at a house
+ Explain why your product is better vs other products
    - not necessarily right, but is done because it improves sales
+ The stakes are different from business ethics to medical ethics
    - Some goods can be life-defining
        + House
+ A model where there is a person who helps guide you to a decision that is in
  your interest
    - Applies to various goods and services
