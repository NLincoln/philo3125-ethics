# Leiser - Truth in the Marketplace
## Using Products for the not originally intended purposes
+ Listerine
    + Floor treatment, gonorrhea treatment
    + Convincing people they have a problem they may or may not have to increase
      sales
+ Silly Putty
    + attempt to create artificial rubber for military application
+ Bubble rap
    + Wall paper

## False claim of effectiveness
+ If it is a problem that doesn't exist, it will be a false claim of
  effectiveness
+ Listerine is effective in laboratory conditions, but not tested on the actual
  mouth
+ Curly hair product works on straws, but may not work on actual hair
+ Hoxsey Method
    - Promoted as a cure for cancer; but, is "worthless and discredited"
    - Is actually harmful to
        + Psychological
        + Made of lye which heats up with water
+ Forms
    - Products that simply do nothing
        + Harms because you could have used the money elsewhere
    - Products that make a problem worse or actively harm you
        + Harms becaues it actively harms you
        + Guilty of assualt in the "legal and moral sense"
+ Solutions
    - Government should regulate false advertisements. It is the governments
      duty to mark all dangerous objects as so
+ Leiser believes than "urging someone to use a product" assumes a responsibility
    - Endorsement of a product
    - using the products
    - Advertisers and salesmen
    - Doctor prescription
    - YouTube and Facebook
+ Actually has lies within them

## Misleading without lying
+ Working on straw and implying it works on hair is misleading, but not
  explicitly wrong
+ "I just had the radiator repaired"
    - A fix for a week misleading the radiator
+ Advertisers need to go above and beyond the law, but the law should be brought
  closer to reality
+ Government regulation may be wrong
    - Some products that aren't considered trustworthy actually are
    - Moral hazard, the government protecting them encourages risky behavior
        - Rugby vs NFL, rugby has less injury 
    - Overly gullible 
    - "The public has no alternative then to the government"
+ Harm principle
    - If you are regulating, there must be a harm to someone other than
      yourself and actually promotes utility instead of harm
    - Leiser does not mention the associated costs, if it would be worth it
+ Suppression of the truth is bad
    - He should not suppress the truth, he should not put his best foot forward,
      etc.
    - Solomon thinks that we would be an idiot not to put best foot forward
