# Is Bluffing Ethical? - Carr
+ Business ethics don't have a high bar
    - "I haven't killed anyone or armed robbery"
    - No considerable sacrifice or holding the moral bar
    - Nothing above the basic expectation
+ It IS Ethical
    - Issue not of ethics but of strategy
## Bluffing doesn't count as being dishonest
+ Falsehood is no longer falsehood when both parties are aware the falsehood
  exists or expecting the truth
    - Preconditions to deceiving
        + Telling computer a falsehood is not a deceived
            - not capable of being deceived 
        + Actors in a movie
## Bluffing counts as deception but is morally non-problematic
+ Private vs Business life
    - role differentiated behavior - professionals can do things it would be
      wrong for us to do
    - Businessman have different rules 
+ Arguments by analogy
    - Inductive argument - If your premises are true, your conclusion is likely
      to be true (not gaurenteed).
    - Target - What we are trying to ascribe a property to
    - Analogs - Things we know properties about and are comparing our target
    - Examples
        - Prescribing the flu based on another persons symptoms
            + **target** - properties a, b, c,
            + **analog** - properties a, b, c, d
            + Target also has d
        - Drugs on mice work on us
        - Precident in law
    - Predictions 
        - The more **relevant** similarities the more confident we can be in our
          solution
        - The more **relevant** disimilarties the less confident we know our
          solution is wrong
        - The broader the argument, the better the prediction
+ Problem of other minds
    - Bodies wearing hats and coats, do not know if they have minds like me
    - Can solve that by argument of analogy?
        + 2 arms, 2 legs, 2 eyes, 2 ears
            - Corpses fall under this definitions
            - relevant dissimilarity (we have heartbeats and they don't)
                + Heart pumps?
## Business and Poker
+ Both business and games like poker have their own kind of ethics
    - Both have a game ethics where deception is an acceptable strategy or
      permissable
+ You have competitors and are trying to win
    - requirement to try to win and advocate for yourself
+ You should not tell the whole truth, you should withhold strategy from
  opponent
+ Rules, as long as you play within the rules you are absolved of guilt
    - Unwritten rules and written 
        - Laws
        - Standards
+ Don't want to follow the golden rule
+ Central questions are one of strategy not of ethics
    - It looks like ethics to be self serving
+ They are similar in certain kinds of ways

## Lying in Business
+ If lying was a rule, business would fall apart whether through general
  permissability
+ Carr
    - If falsehoods are expected to be said they are not falsehoods
    - There is a domain where lying is permissible and business falls under that
      domain because it is like poker
    - The illusion that business can be guided by ethics are guided by "it pays
      to be ethics", self serving, it can make more money in the long run by not
      squeezing people too hard
    - There are times where honesty has the means of getting what you want, but
      you should not be praised for that
        + The truth is a means for business to be sucessful and lying can
          undermine that means
    - Carr and Solomon agree that perception of honesty and integrity is useful.
      But Carr does not argue for generally accepted lying/bluffing practice,
      but only as a last resort
+ Carr and Solomon are on fairly similar grounds
