# Mises - Human Action
+ Praxeology
    - study of human action
    - Deliberate and not a reflex
+ Finite vs Infinite 
    - End state allows for a zero-sum nature because of evaluation of the state
    - Infinite games have no end state
    - Positive sum finite vs infinite games
+ Types of Games
    - One off
        + Prisoners dilemna 
            - Always rat if one off
    - Many, but know number of games
        + Prisoners dilemna
            - Tic for Tac if iterated, but encounters backwards induction
              problem
    - Unknown numbers of game
+ Betting vs Gambling
    - Betting - Know the probabilities of what will play out (risk)
        + Don't know outcome, but know the range of outcomes and associated
          probabilities
    - Gambling - Unknown what the outcomes could be or unknown what associated
      probability will be
        + Can make the same kind of calculated possibilities
## Business and Betting
+ In Poker you're trying to beat other people but business is not necessarily
  the same
    - Businesses try to make the best product regardless of the competition
    - Intention is different
+ Catallactic vs Combat
    - **Catallactic** - Dynamic that sets prices
    - Social Cooperation of competition
        - You get fired, get a raise, or get promoted
+ Game vs Market
    - **game** - beat your competitor, find the winner or loser, finite the game
      will eventually end
    - **market** - attract customers, assign role in which people are best at,
      infinite unknown how long competition will go on for
    - Relationship of competition is different
## Conclusion
+ Business is not like poker, not the bluffing is wrong in business
