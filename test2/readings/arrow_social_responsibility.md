# Arrow - “Social Responsibility and Economic Efficiency”
## Case against Social Responsibility
+ Firms should aim simply to maximize their profits
	- Firms *will* maximize profits
	- Selfish impulse to gain is strong that control is likely to diminish returns
+ Firms ought to maximize profits
	- Social obligation to do so
	- Voluntary contracts
		+ People who buy their goods believe it is worthwhile
		+ increases overall benefit
	- Profit = net contributions
	- Competition breeds net positives for consumers
	- May not go far enough
## Case for Social Responsibility
+ Profit maximizations allows high level of satisfaction for any one consumer
  without affecting other consumers
    - Assumes that forces of competition are sufficiently vigorous
        + Monopolies are bad
        + distrubtion of income is unequal - effeciency creates income
          disparities
    - Points away from altruistic motives
        - Gratification is just as legitimate as selfish motives
        - Pollution or congestion
            + Company pays worker therefore is beneficial transaction
            + no similar mechanism for pollution
            + Cars added make everyone less comfortable
                - Imposes cost on members of the society
+ quality effects about which the firms knows more than the buyer
    - Used car
        + defects which seller knows more about than the buyer
        + willing to pay the same amount for two differing quality cars
        + This behavior may propigate even to sellers of good cars
            - skepticism may drive away business
            - lower the value of his car while raising value of bad car
+ Profit maximization assume that consumer if well informed
+ summary
    - the case in which costs are not paid for
    - case in which seller has considerably more knowledge about his product
      than the buyer
## Methods
+ Institutionalization assures that any one firm will also accept the same
  responsibility
+ Sometime institutions need to be told what they must uphold
    - Legal regulation
    - Taxes
    - Legal liability
    - Ethical codes
        + Medical ethics
