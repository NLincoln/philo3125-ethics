# Friedman - â€œThe Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Profits"
+ Businesses are not people and cannot have social responsibility
    - artificial person and may have artificial repsonsibilities
+ Businessman are responsible of the company and therefore the companies "social
  responsibility"
+ Executive is an agent of the individuals who own the corporation or establish
  the eleemosynary (related to or dependent on charity) institute
    - Responsibility to his employers -> make as much money as possible
+ Executives are their own people
    - Can spend their money on charity, church, city, etc.
    - in his own life, he acts as a principle and not as an agent
        + spending his own time vs the time of his employeer
    - Social responsibilities of individuals not of business
+ Executives that follow "social responsibility" incur cost to employeer
    - Acts in some way that is not of interest to employeer
    - Controls price to stop inflation, but not of the best interest of
      corporation
    - Reduces returns to stock holders, spends customers money, and spends wages
      of others
+ If an executive acts contradictory to the stockholders, he is not following
  their wishes
    - Imposes taxes and decides how the tax proceeds shall be spent
+ Political Principle
    - imposition of taxes and expenditure of proceeds are governmental functions
    - "taxation without representation", checks and balances
    - executive is selected by stockholders to serve their interets
    - public employee, civil servant
        + Should be elected
+ Political Consequence
    - How does he know how it spend the money?
    - What kind of action will contribute to the social end?
    - Expert in running company, not in combating social issues
    - What is justified and appropriate to spend from the consumer?
    - Unions need government interference because of market methods would
      prevent them
        + Cannot exercise social responsibility otherwise
+ Government cannot be only solution, too slow at solving social issues
    - Select few individuals who favor taxes impose their will be undemocractic
      procedures on others
+ Individual propriertors are exempt
    - spends his own money
+ Selfish, long run interests are also exempt
    - corporation may improve community or improve governemnt ot help attract
      desirable employees
    - deducting corporate charities from taxes
    - Goodwill as by-product of expenditures that are justified in
      self-interest
+ Friedman may agree this approaches fraud
+ Free market vs politics
    - Individual free to act on their own vs conforming to general social
      interest
