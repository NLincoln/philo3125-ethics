# Informed Consent
+ Stems from horrors of Nazi medical experimentation
+ Promotes autonomy of the individual in medical decision making
+ Condemned as a myth and as bad medicine
    - incompatibility between the patient autonomy and physician responsibility
      for patients well-being
    - Too many treatments to disclose relevant information about all of them

## Approaches to informed consent: rights vs shared process
+ Patient autonomy
    - response to physician paternalism (complete responsibility for determine
      treatments)
+ Physician is viewed as an expert who should leave his or her values aside and
  only bring technical expertise into play
    - Explain various diagnosis or treatment options 
    - patient considers this information and then chooses the best treatment
    - Fits in religious denial of treatment
    - *shared process*
        - Does not restrict the physician to providing facts and insists that
          the patient supply all values
        - goals, thoughts, and evaluations are transparent to one another
        - Balances accommodating autonomy and beneficence

## Myth 1: Signed consent form is informed consent
+ liability protection, but provide little protection
+ can provide protection if there is a description of risks and other
  information
    - can hurt if not adequate or overly complex information

## Myth 2: Informed Consent is a Medical Miranda Warning
+ if they warn patients of te risks of treatment?
+ Don't focus on risks, focus on therapeutic options 
    - medical and surgical treatments
    - surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy
    - do nothing
+ options + range of consequences

## Myth 3: Informed consent requires that physicians operate a medical cafeteria
+ physician has a role as a medical advisor, not just to give them the info and
  chart their course
+ Patients want information + recommendation
    - form of a conversation in which patients give, ask, and respond to
      information 
    - shared or collaborative decision making (informed consent)
+ Don't necessarily want to micromanage their care, but know goals of
  therapeutic options and when that goal has changed

## Myth 4: Patients must be told everything about treatment
+ Patients only must be given a reasonable amount of information
    - certain states - reasonable physician would disclose
    - other states - kind of information a reasonable patient would find material to making a
      decision about treatment.
+ May inflict emotional distress by disclosing too much

## Myth 5: Patients need full disclosure about treatment only if they consent
+ information about options and their consequences must be provided before
  decision, not after
+ "Here is what is wrong and this is what to do"
    - patients are expected to comply
    - If they say yes, he or she might then receive more information
+ Consent is not forthcoming?
    - information need not be given to patients or if patient goes with
      alternative, no information is needed about rejected treatment
    - Informed refusal as well

## Myth 6: Patients cannot give informed consent because they cannot understand complex medical information
+ It may be true that someone who cannot retain information for a few seconds
  might not be said to understand it, but people make reasonble decisions and
  cannot later recall the premises that supported that decision
    - might has understood it at the time
+ Patients must understand information in the same way and to the same extend as
  the physician?
    - legally incompetent would go under surrogate decision maker
    - understand options and potential risks and benefits
        + different decision from patient does not mean lack of understanding
+ Middle of extreme rightsoriented and stupid patients
    - patients make choice based on their values and way of making sense of the
      world

## Myth 7: Patients must be given information whether they want it or not
+ Patients who choose not to participate in the decision-making process also
  respects their autonomy
+ Compelling patients to receive information they don't want fails to respect
  their dignity
+ Embodies the right to be given information and decide
    - waiving decision rights does not waive information rights
    - may want to participate in the future

## Myth 8: Information ma be withheld if it will cause the patient to refuse treatment
+ therapeutic privilege
    - physician determines that providing the patient with information would
      undermine the goals of informed consent
    - allow physician to honor "primary duty" of protecting what is benficial
      for the patients and avoid inflicting harm on them
+ Withhold only if the disclosure would so upset the patient that he or she
  could not rationally engage in conversation about therapeutic options and
  consequences

## Conclusion
+ Doctors are not waiters, shared decision making
