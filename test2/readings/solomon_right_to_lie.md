# Solomon - Is It Ever Right to Lie?
+ Lying is always a later restory, a strategy that is not a first choice
+ Salesman should sell his wares by saying nothing but the truth
+ One must always excuse a lie by showing that some greater evil would result
  from telling the truth or minimal harm by lying
+ Wrong due to consequences (some circumstances in which it would be wrong not
  to lie)
    - family fights and quarrels among couples
    - prevent bad feelings
+ Reasons lying is always wrong:
    - enormous effort involved in telling a lie
        + cost of cover-up is often many more times the damange done by the lie
          itself
    - Longer-term damage
        - diminishes trust
            + good ads are now caught in a web of distrust
    - If lying was a universal rule, it would not work
+ Types of 'lying':
    1. telling less than the whole truth
    2. telling a biased truth, with one's own interests in mind
    3. idealizing one's products or services
    4. giving misleading information; that is, true statements that are intended
       to be misunderstood or misinterpreted
    5. stating obvious falsehoods
        - Too silly to be true. Advertising overnight from plain jane to super
          sally
    6. stating vicious falsehoods
        - deliberate and possibly dangerous forms of deception
        - product will do X when it will not 
        - intentionally withholding information
+ Misconceptions
    + Advertising is always lying
    + Orwellian zombies
        + Humanity is capable of making their own value judgements
            - condemning all advertising makes it impossible to attack vicious
              advertising - an entire world where no one believes anything
