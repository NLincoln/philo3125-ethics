# Stout - Corporate Purpose
+ Stakeholder theory is very well supported because it is being taught in
  classrooms
    - Does not match empirical evidence
+ What does shareholder value mean?
    - There is no single shareholder value
    - different shareholders have different needs and interests
        + Most people only focus on the short-sighted, myopic shareholders that
          value short term profits
## Where did shareholder value thinking come from?
+ pre 20th century - companies were owned by single shareholder or small group
+ public companies sold stock to hundreds of small investors
+ authority was in boards of directors who hired full-time executives to run
  their companies
+ Who should the corporate managers serve?
    - maximize shareholders wealth?
    - stakeholders (managerialist)
        - employees, customers, and broader society
    - Chicago school says make money for its dispersed shareholder "owners"
        + easy empirical study with stock price
        + easy sound bite firm
        + obvioius villain
        + Simple perscription for corporate ill
            - give shareholders more power
            - give the boards of directors less power
            - incentivize executives and directors by trying pay to share price
+ Laws changes to support the Chicago school idea
    - SEC
    - hostile takeovers easier
    - unlock shareholder value
    - equity-based compensation

## Shareholder Value Thinking Gets the Law Wrong
+ Corporations can be formed for any lawful purpose, not to maximize returns to
  shareholders
    - there purpose can be "anything lawful"
+ Doge v Ford, Michigan supreme court
    - mere dicta, not needed to make desired result
    - business judgment rules
        + directors of public companies enjoy virtually unfettered legal
          discretion to determine the corporations goals
+ Air Products, Inc. v. Airgas, Inc.
    + Air products wanted to acquire Airgas for $70 dollars a share(vs the $40s
      and $50s it was trading)
    + Airgas board refused although airgas shareholders supported sale
    + Delaware court support airgas boards' decision
        - "was not under any per say duty to maximize shareholder value in the
          short term"
+ Free to decide what is in the corporations "long run" interests if they
  believe it will help corp in the long run

## Shareholder Value Gets the Economics Wrong
+ Increased share price is viewed as tantamount to an increase in overall
  economic efficiency
+ principle hires agent to run firm on owners behalf
    - agent does all work but principle gets all profit
    - expect agent to shirk or even steal at the principal's expense
+ Incorrect in three ways:
    - Shareholders "own" corporations, but don't
        + corporations own themes
            - hold property in their own names
            - enter their own contracts
        + Own shares of stock, contracts between the corporation and shareholder
          that give limited rights under limited circumstances (doesn't entitle you
          to a car in the Ford showroom).
            0 bondholders, suppliers, and employees. Contractual relationship with
              corporate entity
    - Shareholders are the sole residual claimants
        + employees, customers, and creditors are assumed to receive only the
          benefits their formal contracts and the law entitle them to
            - shareholders get the rest
        + Only treated this way in brankruptcy 
            - shareholders get money when directors decide the shareholders
              should get money
        + corporation is its own residual claimant, the board decides which
          groups get what share of the coporation's residual
    - shareholders and directors are just principals and agents
        - corporations are controlled by boards of directors, not by
          shareholders
        - shareholders can elect and remove directors
            + cost of mounting proxy battle raises near-insurmountable obstacles
        - cannot sue directors
        - selling en masse is a Pyrrhic victory, destroying the company
+ If changing corporate rules to fit this model improves performance, we should
  see evidence in business world

## How Shareholder Thinking Gets the Evidence Wrong
+ Studys found reducing or eliminating public voting rights found no effect on
  performance (or greatly improved)
    - Opposite of what one would expect
+ studys only look at one company for a limited period of time
    - individual firms relative to the rest of the market may reduce aggregate
      shareholder wealth over time
    - Fishing with worm vs minnows vs dynamite

## There is No Single "Shareholder Value"
+ Different shareholders care about different things
+ different strategies can benefit some while hurtig others

## Revisiting the idea of corporate purpose
+ Even if shareholders are the only participants in corporatoin we care, we
  cannot reduce shareholders' interest to single metric of today's share price
+ shareholder cannot be PLatonic entity that cares only about the market price
+ Single, objective metrics allow us to hold corporate agents accountable?
    - we balance competing interests and responsibilities all the time
        + multiple kids
        + research and scholarships
+ quixotic

## Summary
+ inconsitent with corporate law
+ misstates the economic structure of public companies
+ lacks empirical support
