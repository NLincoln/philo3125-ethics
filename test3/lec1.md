# Singer - Famine Affluence Morality
+ Effective alturism movement
    - change how people lived, I will work on wall street to maximize lifetime
      income to give money awy
+ Cases
    + Dora and the Child
        - sells a kid for "adoption", buys a tv, then attempts to save the kid
    + Bob's Bugatti
        - Bugatti vs Child for train, trolley car problem
    + Drowning person
        - You are walking buy shallow pond, you wearing your fancies clothes,
          someone is drowning, saving child ruins job interview and nicest suit
    + First world privileges
        - smart phones, drafting, malaria, parastic worms, famines

+ Bengal Famine
    + Developed world world could help, but is more concerned with other things
        - Australia gave 1/12th the amount of the opera house
        - Britian and France - Spend more on concord (30x)
        - few individuals are taking actions to prevent aide
        - America withheld aide because bengal was selling to cuba
+ Principles 
    - A 
        + We don't have to sacrifice 5 moral units for 4 moral units
        > it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without
        > thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought,
        > morally, to do it
    - B
        - We don't have to do any kind of morally significant sacrifices
        - more moderate
        > if it is in our power to prevent something very bad from happening,
        > without thereby sacrificing anything morally significant, we ought,
        > morally, to do it. 
+ Captures the drowning child case
    - Child is more morally important than suit, save the child
+ Bob's bugatti
    -  His retirement is not morally important at all, he must prevent the death
       of a child
+ Principle A - guide dog for blind person money could be used to save many
  people
+ Why don't we follow this principle?
    - Distance from others 
        + does distances morally matter? No.
        + does distance matter pratically? Yes, could in theory do more for the
          people around you spending less money. But, this transporation concern
          has mostly been solved
        + Out of sight out of mind? Large famine is hard to ignore
    - Citizenship, duty to help fellow citizens
        + does not buy the partiality, if all lives are equal you must treat
          them as such
    - If everyone made a small sacrifice we would solve the problem
        + Only responsible for making a small contribution if everyone else did
          their fair share
        + Not how the world works in reality
        + Other people may not save the drowning child, but that doesn't
          necessarily save you from the moral obligation
+ Principle A consequences
    - Line between charity and duty shifts
        - Charity is normally considered "superarrogitory", but falls apart in
          the drowning child case. Might be a moral duty
    - Obligation to give - a lot
        + Demanding account
    - Give both materials (resources) and time
    - sacrificing your free time may sacrifice you doing something of moral
      significance
        + Time with friends, cultivate and care for obligations we have to
          others
            - May not work with the strict principle, but with the moderate
+ Principle A Objections
    - Demandingness
        + You may have to give until you are suffering as much as the people you are
          trying to help
        + Can give much more before you get to the point where you would suffer
    - Role of Governments, not individuals
        - Interest inference, if people are not interested why should it be
          interested
    - Population concern
        + Deeper problem that causes famine, too many people?
        + if you think is problem, you should be working to solve that
            - education
            - economic development
                + Kids are expensive in time and monetary amount
                    - Kids are a type of insurance for when you're poor, sick,
                      etc.
                + you may have a duty to develop the economy and agriculture
    - If you think the government give more and the population problem is the
      deeper one, you should go out and campaign about it
    - If the solution is a bandaid, fix the actual problem
+ Needs a full moral theory
    - Does not tell you what is of moral significance which affects the weak
      principle heavily
        + Weak principle is too weak, therefore non issue
        + Most people would self-admit they do things that are not morally
          significant
