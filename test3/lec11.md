# IQ2US - Abolish the Minimum Wage
+ Abolished vs Not Abolish
+ Acceptable range of discourse is not that it should be abolished or show it be
  raised, lowered, or held
+ If everyone gets paid $10 an hour, then having a $7.50 minimum wage does not
  preclude everyone from entering the market. Functionally not doing anything
+ **For**
    - Russ Roberts - Hover Institution (econ talk)
        + Unfair barrier to people's who marginal benefit is not worth the
          minimal wage. Wrongfully precludes
        + Is the world better with the minimum wage? Does minimum wage actually
          make people worse off
        + There are underlying reasons for why these people are the worst of
            - Low skill - poor education
            - must compete with automation
            - minimum wage is not an effective way to help them
        + Laudible to help, but we must consider that the best intentions do not
          always produce the best results
        + Internships
            - You pay someone nothing for valuable experience, but if I want to
              pay anyone between 0 and the minimum wage is legally and morally
              wrong
    - James Dorm
        + Empricial literature is on our side. The hong kong example shows the
          minimum wage is on our side. What is important is opportunities,
          minimum wage hurts those opportunities.
        + Produces subsitutions - self-checkout, travel agents, out source to
          other places
        + Jobs that take very little skill but are not worth minimum wage
        + Changes take a long time to take affect into the work place for
          minimum wage
+ **Against**
    + Bernstien 
        - Policy that is effective and effecient method way of raising wages
          without causing widescale unemployment
        - empricial literature show it doesn't cause unemployment to a
          reasonable wage
    + Cornblew
        - People who make the minimum wage are helped by increasing the minimum
          wage
        - There is a population that would be harmed by abolishing the minimum
          wage
        - Don't have to abolish the minimum wage to solve the problem
            + Make a seperate minimum wage for the affected workers
    + It would be dangerous to eliminate the minimum wage
        - It would be irresponsible because we don't know the risk, if we don't
          have good evidence maybe we should take a precautionary approach
        - 10% increase of minimum wage hurts 1%, worthy tradeoff. 99% for 1%%
            - Making zero is bad which does not help low skilled worker, maybe
              does not maximize overall aggregate utility
+ No consideration
    - Minimum wage impact prices such housing, goods, etc.
    - what counts as a living wage and what counts as a living wage
    - impacts in the workplace
    - exploitation - Zwolonski argument is morally transformative
    - decriminialization of drugs - don't illegalize behavior that does not
      affect others
+ Both sides
    - Claim empirical literature on both sides
+ Bootleggers and Baptists
    - When we consider regulations, people advocating for them are often strange
      bedfellows.
    - 2014 Arkansas alcohol legalization - Stores in wet counties don't want to
      lose customers and religious leaders don't want to lose souls
    - Amazon - minimum wage for all workers if $15 an hour, but is telling all
      states to also do that. He can afford it
    - Pollution - New pollution regulations grandfather in old factories because
      any would be competitor must pay for the additional technology
