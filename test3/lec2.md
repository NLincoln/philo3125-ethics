# Cassidy - Women Shopping and Women Sweatshopping
+ What are our responsiblities as we shop?
+ Pogge
    - We are responsible for making the Global South poorer
    - We threw the child into the lake and therefore have responsibility to save
      it
    - "You break it, you bought it"
    + Government fines persons for damages
        - If cop gets in trouble, the citizens must pay for it
        - You can potentially be responsible for what you government once did
+ Scheffler
    - Presents a common sense view of how to think about responsibilities,
      globalism changes that view
    - *restricted* 
        + Our duties to not harm are stronger than those to help / lend aid
        + We can have preference for people we know, strangers are less
          important
        + Works in small communities, but it may be difficult in globalism
    - May have to abandon this view as globalization increases, may have changed
      how things are
+ Responsibility
    - Credit Sense
        + If you do an action that has a negative result in past, you have a
          responsibility to fix it in the present
        + Who was the cause of some event and thereby who is responsible
        + Hard in globalized
            - We cannot always state that someone is causal responsible
            - Are you responsible for factory farming because you purchase
              factory farming food?
        + Plays no role in the singer account
            - Even if you didn't throw the child in, you must still save them
    - Management Sense
        + Consider the possible alternative actions, select what action you will
          pursue, and to pursue that course of action
        + Management of normal, ordinary things
            - time, money, resources
        + Not valuing the child is a mis-evaluation
    - Care taking sense
        + Certain relationships that you have an obligation to ensure are
          healthy
        + More binding than duties to strangers
        + If you get a dog, you have certain responsibilities to it
        + Responsible for caring for it (and caring about)
            - Not the same a child, pet, or sibling
    - Too much has been placed on the credit sense, is all the matters causal
      relationships?
        + Hard to tell in globalist scenario
        + How do we care about those around the world
+ No outright conclusion
    - Every action will be variable
    - Everyone is in different circumstances and will have to respond to the
      world in different ways
        + If you have children you wouldn't have the same actions as people who
          don't
    - Obligation to consider alternative opportunities
    - duty to take care of your children
