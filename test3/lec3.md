# Krugman - In Praise of Cheap Labor
+ Smokey Mountain - "Poverty Tourism"
    - Global poverty looks like absent of sweatshops or other globalisation
    - closed because it offends their sensibilities
+ While these conditions are bad, they are better than the less visible rural
  poverty
+ People don't like global trade (violence, distruction of property, etc.)
+ Bastiat 
    - Candlemakers petition government to protect the candles from the natural
      sun
    - Parable of the Broken Window
        + The boy who broke the window did a good by giving a glazier money
        + If you want to make jobs, go break windows
        + The cost of repairing the window could have gone to something else
            - Shifted the jobs from the cobbler to the glazier
            - The guy with the window is now worse off
    - "Wars are good for economies", "Hurricanes are good for economies"
        + Just go destroy buildings and cause war yourself
        + What else could have happened?
+ When you have a sweatshop
    - Less pressure is put on the land, fewer people are working on marginally
      producive land, you can let land lie fallow 
+ What about the children?
    - They have to go make money somewhere else, out in the streets
    - Prostitution
    - End up in even worse jobs
+ Sweatshops seem to be a way out of poverty, seem to go to worse alternatives
+ WTO Protest Reasons
    - Slavery (Slave wages), Bad working conditions
    - Free trade instead of fair trade (competitive labor standards)
    + Counter Reasons
        - Blatant protectionism
            + Do not want to compete against someone doing the same job for less
              money
        - Want higher wages
            + Compassion and first world has advantages at an easier standard
                - Closer to the market (expensive to move across ocean)
                - techonological advantages
                - tariff (government protection)
                - security (stable political institutions)
            + Only way people in third world can compete is incredibly low wages
        - People working in sweatshop tend to make the median wage
            + Raises wages of farmers who need the land
        - When sweatshops move in, average calories per day increase
          (2100->2800)
        - Venezula (full day you can afford 2 eggs)
            + Month and a half for a big mac
+ Uncleanliness from hearing their t-shirts were made in sweatshops
    - without sweatshops, they would be in even worse conditions
    - no responsible the in management sense and the caretaking sense
+ By trying to fight against sweatshops you are mismanaging and not taking care
    + Might by trying to help them, but are making them worse (smother the
      hamster by not knowing how to take care of them)
