# Zwolinski - Sweatshops Choice and Exploitation
+ Moral Transforming power of consent
    - Examples
        + Doctors cutting you open
        + Sexual consent
        + You can kill someone with their consent?
        + German Cannabal
            - Someone put out an ad for someone to eat them, should we
              interject?
    - Puts certain obligations on third parties
        + Would be wrong for someone to walk into operating room and interfere
          with your surgery
    - Sometimes it is morally wrong for someone to participate, but it is still
      morally wrong it interfere
        + The fact that they consented (amputate limb, drugs, etc.) still
          imposes burden on other not to interfere
    - Interference depends on if there are harms to third parties
## Choices
- Autonomy-Exercising
    + You make a kind of choice as a result of choosing, you are exercising
      your autonomy
        - Worthly of our respect because the express the agents will or
          expressive self
        - examples
            + Smoking
            + Religion
                - might be wrong for you, may disagree with reasons;
                  however, we should respect your decision to endorse the
                  religion
            + Voting
            + Tattoos
            + Major
    + Choices made under some kinds of cohersion aren't actually autonomous,
      but Zwolinski challenges that
    + Cannot act paternalistically
- Preference-Evincing choice (most of the debate)
    + Evidence of what your preferences are
    + If you're ignorant of certain details we can then act
      paternalistically
    + Example
        - Accomidating vs Curmudgeonly
            + Even though you're not acting in full autonomy, it would still
              be wrong for a third party to give you the meal to give you
              what you had preference for
            + It would still be wrong for a third party to interfere
## The Argument
+ Most sweatshop workers choose to accept the conditions of their employment,
  even if their choice is made from among a severely constrained set of
  options.
    - If slavery, it does not matter
+ The fact that they choose the conditions of their employment from within a
  constrained set of options is strong evidence that they view it as their
  most-preferred option (within that set).
    - Do choices display preferences?
+ The fact that they view it as their most-preferred option is strong evidence
  that we will harm them by taking that option away.
+ It is also plausible that sweatshop workers' choice to accept the conditions
  of their employment is sufficiently autonomous that taking the option of
  sweatshop labor away from them would be a violation of their autonomy.
+ All else being equal, it is wrong to harm people or to violate their autonomy.
+ Therefore, all else being equal, it is wrong to take away the option of sweat
  shop labor from workers who would otherwise choose to engage in
+ Constraints
    - Cannot claim a priori that all sweatshops are justified as per (1) and (2).
      Have to do some kind of investigation about the empirical facts
    - Only shows that it a prima facia wrong
+ When the argument is defeated
    - Anything you would be allowed to do to protect innocent third party
        + Ban sweatshot, make them pay costs, etc.

### Voluntary Self-Regulation
+ Industry wide regulation, setting a rule for the whole industry
    - Some of them against their will, will be held to this regulation
+ It will be almost like a legal regulation
    - certain kinds of compliance cost which will cause factories to cloes
    - potential transactions that would not be able to occur 
    - A new factory could not open that doesn't meet regulation therefore
      certain people couldn't work
+ Someone wants to get a job, but they're not productive enough to earn a
  minimum wage
    - $15 minimum wage with all of the costs associated with screwups and
      training, people will just not hire you and will have no job
    - Some third world workers will accept certain conditions and pay but will
      have no opportunity to
+ Interference is allowed when paying for more attracting better workers

### Objections
#### Failures of Voluntariness
+ Are they really making a choice if their options are super limited?
    - Ignorance - don't know the choices
    - Failure of rationality - Might know all the facts, but fail to make a
      choice because you are irrational. 
+ Mugging case
    - If someone says "your money or your life", you give up your money. Someone
      cannot come in and interfere saying "no, you must retain your honor and
      give up your life"
+ If you're concerned if workers are ignorant of other opportunity, you should
  not close down sweatshops but teach them to make better decisions
    - disclosure requirements
+ Seems to target premise 1, 2, and 4
#### Failures of Independence
+ Concern of crowding out better alternatives
+ Might surpress unionization
+ Can't a priori determine if there is independence, must look at individual
  cases
    - On average it pays more
    - if sweatshop is better place to work than domestic producer doesn't matter
+ Krugman says that it makes more better off
+ Failure to unionize is only a failure of independence if this prevents
  unionization in other industries or factories
+ Talks about argument 5

#### Exploit 
+ Sweatshops will exploit the workers regardless of their willingness
    - Physical abuse
    - Poor working conditions
+ Even though it is not morally good or right, the workers still choose to put
  themselves in those situations voluntarially
    - Preference-evincing choice
    - Harm principle
+ Tugboat demands 1000 pounds to save this other boat, the boat must choose
  between sinking or paying a ton of money
    - They then sue to tugboat and get 800 back
    - Mutually beneficial exploitation
        + The boat gets more by being saved then losing everything
        + Might be wrong as there is an uneven distribution of benefits
        + One party is not as well off as they should have been
+ Exploitative wages
    - Possible they could be making more money by going somewhere else
    - Sweatshop still pay their workers which is better than doing nothing
        + Non interaction that leaves people worse off is seemingly better than
          interaction the leaves people better off
+ 1-5 might be true, but that doesn't mean we should endorse the conclusion
    - Moral wrong of exploitation occurring 

## Other considerations
+ Jobs are lost by factories moving overseas, but are you wrongfully harmed?
    - Concert ticket, you don't get a ticket because they run out, have the
      people infront of you wrongfully harmed oyu?
    - From utilitiarian point of view, it seems that doing this provides a net
      benefit
    - From prioritiarian, it is clearly better. Favor those who are worse off
      to ensure they get a first or larger distribution
