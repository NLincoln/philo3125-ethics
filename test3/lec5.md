# Bok - Whistleblowing and Professional Responsibility
+ Solomon - Said it is always wrong to lie
+ Is this sufficiently bad to whistleblow on?
+ Psycologically Hard
    - Bystander effect or milgrim experiments
    - No one want to be a rat
+ Not whistleblowers
    - Acting out of spite
    - Exposing for engrandizing themselves
+ Method for determining whistleblowing
    - Aiming to spotlight for neglect or abuses the public interests from inside
        + Reporter, consumser, etc. cannot be a whistleblower
+ Elements of Whistleblowing (important)
    + Dissent
        - upsets a hierarchy, within business organization there is a hierarchy
          of control
        - presumably you believe that people who are in control are not doing
          the right thing
        - conflict between conforming and sticking neck out
            + Whistleblowing is not costless, putting self of serious risk of a
              particular cost
                - Fired
                - Other companies many not want to hire you
                - retaliation
                - make continuing to work their misreable, location and/or tasks
                - psychatric review
                - hiring expensive lawyers to defend
                - Losing friends
    + Breach of loyalty
        - violate trust of people who hired them, coworkers, etc.
            + conflict between public interest and place of employment
    + Accusation
        - You must be saying that someone is responsible
            + Sounding an alarm for an avalanche, you are not whistleblowing
              because no one is responsible
            + Must be an imminent risk of harm, cannot be of the past
                - risks far in the future fail to be compelling
                - Is this true?
                    + Might be the release of a drug where negative side effects
                      aren't noticed for a couple of decades
                    + NASA hiding the fact that asteriod could kill us in 70
                      years (the actual harm may not be felt, but there is a
                      point of no return. Preperation must happen in order to
                      stop the asteriod)
                - Something they do not know or significance they do not grasp
        - Must be able to ellicit a public response 
            + Public must be able to do something about it
            + If there are not alternatives or people are not empthatic then not
              whistleblowing

+ Duties corresponding to elements of whistleblowing
    - Dissent
        + An accurate judgement of
            + harms and benefits
            + is whistleblowing required
    - Breach of loyalty
        + Tried internal channels to fix things
        + Loyalty can be taken too far with basises like in the Toby Groves case
    - Accusations
        + Must be fair:
            - ensure that you have the right responsible parties
            - not overstate the accusations
            - mitigating circumstances
            - Can you engage in anonymous whistleblowing?
                + How can we engage in the credibility of accusation?
                + However, protects the whistleblower from retaliation
+ Slandering vs Whistleblowing
    - Particular motivations for whistleblowing
        + Spite or arousing public responses
        + If you're becoming famous or making money, whistleblowing will be less
          effective because people will doubt your motivations
            - If you do it to mitigate the harms of whistleblowing then it is
              okay
