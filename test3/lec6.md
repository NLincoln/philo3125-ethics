# David - Some Paradoxes of Whistle-Blowing
+ Modus Podus vs. Modus Ponens
    - If x then y
+ Roger Boisjoly
    - Testified in front of committee to prevent falsification of the record
    - Attempt to try to stop the launch due to freezing temperature
+ Standard Theory
    + Morally required whistle-blowing will prevent harm from others
    + Morally Good vs Morally required Samartian
        - We are all required to act in minimally decent samaratianism
        - Not required to do good samartianism on most theories (includes a large
          cost to ones self)
    + Paradoxes
        - Paradox of Burden
            + In order for standard theory to work, it must be minimally decent
              samartianism. Most cases incur great cost to themselves.
            + Boisjoly must see therapist, move boulders until he sleeps
            + Some people lose careers or flee countries
            + On the standard theory, whistleblowing is easy to do. Emprically this
              does not make sense
        - Paradox of Missing Harm
            + You must have a loose definition of harm if whistle-blowing prevents
              kind of harm in the standard theory
            + Hard to find the harm that is prevented
            + Declaring you don't want to be apart of it
        - Paradox of failure
            + Looks like you will consistently fail to prevent harm joined with
              missing harm
            + By whistle-blowing you automatically succeed in complicity theory
+ Complicity theory
    - Whistle-blowers are not engaging in easy rescues, but the whistle-blower is
      somehow complicit in wrongdoing
    - Seems to go along with the elements of Bok's claim
        + Except with accusation
            - Bok - Accusing other members of the organization
            - Complicity - The organization and yourself
    - Bok vs Complicity theory
        + Motivations
            - Public interest vs Absolving yourself of complicity does something
              for you
        + Spy example
            - If you find papers from another department that implicates the
              company in some wrongdoing, you are a self appointed spy
            - Davis - Must be engaged what the wrongdoing is
            - Bok - Not clear if you must be engaged or if you have to be a
              member of that business
    - Poge
        + You are complicit in the government and therefore you can be taxed,
          but if you lose an election are you still complicit?
