# Duska - Whistle-Blowing and Employee Loyalty
+ It is likely true that whistleblowers incur serious cost to themselves
+ Some praise whistleblowers, some admonish. Have instrumental value of telling
  information about businesses
    - Bok and Bowie violates a prima facia duty of loyalty to ones employer
+ Duska - One does not have an obligation of loyalty to company
    - It would be nonsense to ask how much pain is the moon in?
+ It would be wrong to take them as objects of loyalty
    - Elevate the means to being an ends, incorrectly direct your feelings to
      something that is not worthy of being loyal
+ It is impossible for a company to be an object of loyalty
    - Unicorns are not proper objects of love because they do not exist
+ Ideas about groups
    + Idealist about groups
        - abstract object above and beyond and above the company
    + Atomist
        - There is no desk, there is 100 parts arranged desk wise
        - Impossible to feel loyalty to a company because there are no companies
    + 101 = 100 parts + the desks
+ Some groups that genuinely exist and others that do not
    - Family vs Company
        + Not bound together for fulfillment and support but for division of
          labor and profit
        + Company feels no loyalty to workers for business functions
        + Demand of self sacrifice
        + Instrumental and transactional
    - Teams vs Company
        + Make a mistake when saying a company is like a team
        + See players are loyal to team and players are not loyal to teams
        + Not obvious that teams are like family and not like business
+ May be wrong for you to feel loyalty to your barber, but you may feel loyalty
  and go to it for years
    - Mutual pursuit of profit may be enough to have loyalty
    - Scrooge vs Bob Cratchit
